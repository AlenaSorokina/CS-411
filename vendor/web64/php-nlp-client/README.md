### Laravel Package
There is also a Laravel wrapper for this library available here: https://github.com/web64/laravel-nlp

## Installation
```bash
composer require web64/php-nlp-client
```

## NLP Server
Most NLP features in this package requires a running instance of the NLP Server, which is a simple python flask app providing web service api access to common python NLP libraries.

Installation instrcuctions: https://github.com/web64/nlpserver

## Entity Extraction - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
This library provides access to three different methods for entity extraction.

| Provider  | Language Support | Programming Lang. | API Access |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Polyglot](https://polyglot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  | 40 languages  | Python | NLP Server |
| [Spacy](https://spacy.io/)  | 7 languages | Python | NLP Server |
| [CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/download.html)  | 6 languages  | Java | CoreNLP Standalone server |

If you are dealing with text in English or one of the major European language you will get the best results with CoreNLP or Spacy.

The quality of extracted entities with Polyglot is not great, but for many languages it is the only available option at the moment.

Polyglot and Spacy NER is accessible thorough the NLP Server, CoreNLP requires its own standalone java server.

## Usage

### Language detection:

```php
$nlp = new \Web64\Nlp\NlpClient('http://localhost:6400/');
$detected_lang = $nlp->language( "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" );
// 'en'
```

### Article & Metadata Extraction

```php
// From URL
$nlp = new \Web64\Nlp\NlpClient('http://localhost:6400/');
$newspaper = $nlp->newspaper('https://github.com/web64/nlpserver');

// or from HTML
$html = file_get_contents( 'https://github.com/web64/nlpserver' );
$newspaper = $nlp->newspaper_html( $html );

Array
(
    [article_html] => <div><h1><a id="user-content-nlp-server" class="anchor" href="#nlp-server"></a>NLP Server</h1> .... </div>
    [authors] => Array()
    [canonical_url] => https://github.com/web64/nlpserver
    [meta_data] => Array()

)
```


### Entitiy Extraction & Sentiment Analysis (Polyglot)
This uses the Polyglot multilingual NLP library to return entities and a sentiment score for given text.Ensure the models for the required languages are downloaded for Polyglot.

```php
$polyglot = $nlp->polyglot_entities( $text, 'en' );

$polyglot->getSentiment(); // -1

$polyglot->getEntityTypes(); 
/*
Array
(
    [Locations] => Array
    (
        [0] => United Kingdom
    )
    [Organizations] =>
    [Persons] => Array
    (
        [0] => Ben
        [1] => Sir Benjamin Hall
        [2] => Benjamin Caunt
    )
)
*/

$polyglot->getLocations();  // Array of Locations
$polyglot->getOrganizations(); // Array of organisations
$polyglot->getPersons(); // Array of people

$polyglot->getEntities();
/*                                              
Returns flat array of all entities
Array                                          
(                                              
    [0] => Ben                                 
    [1] => United Kingdom                      
    [2] => Sir Benjamin Hall                   
    [3] => Benjamin Caunt                      
)
*/
```



### Entity Extraction with Spacy
```php
$text = "Harvesters is a 1905 oil painting on canvas by the Danish artist Anna Ancher, a member of the artists' community known as the Skagen Painters.";

$nlp = new \Web64\Nlp\NlpClient('http://localhost:6400/');
$entities = $nlp->spacy_entities( $text );
/*
Array
(
    [DATE] => Array
        (
            [0] => 1905
        )

    [NORP] => Array
        (
            [0] => Danish
        )

    [ORG] => Array
        (
            [0] => the Skagen Painters
        )

    [PERSON] => Array
        (
            [0] => Anna Ancher
        )
)
*/
```

English is used by default. To use another language,  ensure the Spacy language model is downloaded and add the language as the second parameter
```php
$entities = $nlp->spacy_entities( $spanish_text, 'es' );
```

### Sentiment Analysis

```php
$sentiment = $nlp->sentiment( "This is the worst product ever" );
// -1

$sentiment = $nlp->sentiment( "This is great! " );
// 1

// specify language in second parameter for non-english
$sentiment = $nlp->sentiment( $french_text, 'fr' );
```

### Neighbouring words (Embeddings)
```php
$nlp = new \Web64\Nlp\NlpClient('http://localhost:6400/');
$neighbours = $nlp->neighbours('obama', 'en');
/*
Array
(
    [0] => Bush
    [1] => Reagan
    [2] => Clinton
    [3] => Ahmadinejad
    [4] => Nixon
    [5] => Karzai
    [6] => McCain
    [7] => Biden
    [8] => Huckabee
    [9] => Lula
)
*/
```

### Summarization
Extract short summary from a long text
```php
$summary = $nlp->summarize( $long_text );
```


### Readability
Article Extraction using python port of Readability.js

```php
$nlp = new \Web64\Nlp\NlpClient( 'http://localhost:6400/' );

// From URL:
$article = $nlp->readability('https://github.com/web64/nlpserver');

// From HTML:
$html = file_get_contents( 'https://github.com/web64/nlpserver' );
$article = $nlp->readability_html( $html );

/*
Array
(
    [article_html] => <div><h1>NLP Server</h1><p>Python 3 Flask web service for easy access to multilingual NLP tasks ...
    [short_title] => web64/nlpserver: NLP Web Service
    [text] => NLP Server Python 3 Flask web service for easy access to multilingual NLP tasks such as language detection  ...
    [title] => GitHub - web64/nlpserver: NLP Web Service
)
*/
```

## CoreNLP - Entity Extraction (NER) 
CoreNLP has much better quality for NER that Polyglot, but only supports a few languages including English, French, German and Spanish.

Download CoreNLP server (Java) here: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/index.html#download

### Install CoreNLP
```bash
# Update download links with latest versions from the download page

wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-corenlp-full-2018-10-05.zip
unzip stanford-corenlp-full-2018-10-05.zip
cd stanford-corenlp-full-2018-02-27

# Download English language model:
wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-english-kbp-corenlp-2018-10-05-models.jar
```

### Running the CoreNLP server
```bash
# Run the server using all jars in the current directory (e.g., the CoreNLP home directory)
java -mx4g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer -port 9000 -timeout 15000

# To run server in as a background process
nohup java -mx4g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer -port 9000 -timeout 15000 &
```
When the CoreNLP server is running you can access it on port 9000: http://localhost:9000/
